This walkthrough documents the basic penetration testing steps performed on the **Sunset 1** vulnerable machine.

We simulate a real-world attack by exploiting FTP, cracking password hashes, and gaining access via SSH.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Lab Setup

* **Attacker Machine:** Kali Linux (or Parrot OS)
* **Target Machine:** Sunset 1 (downloaded and running in VirtualBox/VMware)
* **Network Mode:** Both machines are connected to the **same Host-Only / Bridged Network**.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Network Discovery

**Goal:** Find the target machine's IP address.

### ‚úÖ Tool: `netdiscover`

```bash
sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.1.0/24
```

* This scans the subnet for active IP addresses.
* Look for a new device on the network (often labeled as unknown or with no hostname).

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Port Scanning

**Goal:** Identify open ports and running services.

### ‚úÖ Tool: `nmap`

```bash
sudo nmap -A -T4 <TARGET_IP>
```

* `-A`: Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning
* `-T4`: Speeds up the scan
* Look for FTP (port 21), SSH (22), web ports (80, 443), etc.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ FTP Enumeration & Access

**Goal:** Connect to FTP and check if anonymous login is enabled.

### ‚úÖ Tool: `ftp`

```bash
ftp <TARGET_IP>
```

If prompted for a username, try:

```text
Name: anonymous
Password: [press Enter]
```

* If access is granted, list files with `ls`
* Look for interesting files (e.g., `hashes.txt`, `users.txt`, etc.)

Download files using:

```bash
get hashes.txt
```

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Crack Hashes

**Goal:** Use John the Ripper to crack password hashes from downloaded files.

### ‚úÖ Tool: `john`

```bash
john hashes.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

* This attempts to crack passwords using the **rockyou.txt** wordlist.
* Once cracked, use:

```bash
john --show hashes.txt
```

To display the cracked usernames and passwords.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ SSH Access

**Goal:** Use the cracked credentials to log into the system.

### ‚úÖ Tool: `ssh`

```bash
ssh <username>@<TARGET_IP>
```

* Enter the cracked password when prompted.
* If successful, you now have shell access to the target machine.

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Step | Description                    | Tool          |
| ---- | ------------------------------ | ------------- |
| 1    | Discover target IP             | `netdiscover` |
| 2    | Scan for open ports            | `nmap`        |
| 3    | Access FTP and download hashes | `ftp`         |
| 4    | Crack password hashes          | `john`        |
| 5    | Log into system with SSH       | `ssh`         |

This basic workflow demonstrates key stages in a real-world attack: **reconnaissance**, **enumeration**, **exploitation**, and **privilege access**. You can extend this further by escalating privileges and establishing persistence.
