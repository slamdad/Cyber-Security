Basic Pentesting Notes (Mapped to Hacker Methodology)
1. Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)
Goal: Identify live hosts, target services, and web directories.

Tool: netdiscover
Discover live IPs in the local network.

bash

sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.1.0/24
Tool: nmap
Port scanning, service enumeration, OS detection.

bash

sudo nmap -A -T4 192.168.1.10

2. Scanning & Enumeration
Goal: Dig deeper into discovered services and find potential entry points.

Tool: gobuster
Discover hidden web files/folders (useful for LFI, uploads).

bash

gobuster dir -u http://10.10.203.245 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

3. Gaining Access
Goal: Exploit vulnerable services or upload malicious payloads.

PHP Reverse Shell (Pentestmonkey)

Download from: https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell

Edit the script’s IP and port (use your attacking machine’s IP).

Upload shell.php and trigger via browser.

Tool: netcat
Listen for incoming reverse shell connections.

bash

nc -lvnp 4444
Bonus: Stabilizing the Shell (Post-Exploitation Prep)
Why: Raw reverse shells lack terminal features (arrow keys, job control, etc.), making further work difficult.

How to stabilize:

In the shell, run:

bash

python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
Press Ctrl + Z to background the shell.

Run locally:

bash

stty raw -echo; fg
export TERM=xterm

This makes the shell behave like a fully interactive terminal.
