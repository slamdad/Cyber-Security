The CIA Triad – 3 Pillars of Security

- Confidentiality – Keeping information private (e.g., encrypting files)
- Integrity – Ensuring data isn't tampered with (e.g., using checksums/hashes)
- Availability – Keeping systems running (e.g., backups, anti-DDoS)

AAA – Authentication, Authorization, Accounting

- Authentication – Proving your identity (username & password)
- Authorization – Determining access rights (admin vs. regular user)
- Accounting – Tracking who did what and when
